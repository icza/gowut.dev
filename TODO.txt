
-New event response action: show a dialog (e.g. confirmation, input).
After dialog is closed, it should generate a new event transferring the action/input from the dialog.

-Clicking on the icon of the Expander's header should also expand/collapse.
This might require to add the icon as a separate component, and also register event handler to it.
(Unless the style of the header's component is modified - which I want to avoid.)

-Event request might contain rendered dirty comps right away, making additional calls to render comps needless -> faster response overall

-Include ohlow widgets in the Html demo of the showcase app? https://www.ohloh.net/p/gowut/widgets

-New param when sending/receiving actions: start cycle to detect if server was restarted.

-Make Showcase app available live (on AppEngine)

-Additional "internal" events:
	-link activated (maybe this is already covered with ETYPE_ONCLICK? check it!)
	-image loaded/failed

-Refactor: TabBarPlacement => SidePlacement (same constants: TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT)?

-ImageButton or SetImage() method for Button

-Implement Comp.RemoveEHandler() and Comp.RemoveEHandlerFunc() (and use it when removing tabs or expander headers...)

-New components:
	-new comps for input type (problem: weak support, mostly just by Chrome and Opera): date; color; range (jslider)
	-SuggestBox
	-Absolute Panel
	-Dialogs/Popups
	-Slider
	-iframe, in the showcase app it should link/contain the source code of the showcase app!
	-ProgressBar
	-Form (+ fileuploader, submit button)
	-Audio and Video (HTML5)
	-YouTube


-On client side display a progress icon while waiting for events or refreshing comps.
Also display an error icon if an ajax call fails, gather messages and list them all when clicked.


-Allow replacing root window (at Server)
	-Consider a Home Window (also replacable)


-Ability to "push" from server to client (not just when an event is received).
	-websocket?

-Somehow save window state and reload. (serialization)

-LIMITATIONS @ doc.go

-More return actions for events: "redirect to a URL (e.g. another window)", "show an alert or confirm. dialog"
